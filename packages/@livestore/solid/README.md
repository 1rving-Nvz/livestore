# @livestore/solid

Note: This package is still experimental and unstable. Please open an issue if you're running into any issues or share your feedback on Discord.

## Remaining tasks (contributions welcome!)

- [ ] Add tests (unit and integration similar to `@livestore/react`)
- [ ] Documentation (similar to `@livestore/react`)
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments
- Functionality
  - [ ] Support for multiple concurrent store instances
  - [ ] Remove need for default value
  - [ ] Avoid null-optionality branching
- [ ] Make LiveStore devtools work with Solid (there's currently a "conflict" between the Solid vite plugin and the LiveStore devtools plugin which depends on React)
