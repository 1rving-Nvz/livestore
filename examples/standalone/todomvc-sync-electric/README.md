# TodoMVC Example

[Demo](https://todovmc.livestore.dev)

## Running locally

Note you'll also need to run the Electric server locally for the app to work (see below).

```bash
pnpm
pnpm dev
```

Note that due to vinxi, the devtools are served on: `/_build/_livestore`

### Running the Electric server locally

```bash
cd .infra
docker compose up -d
```
