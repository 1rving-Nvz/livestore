## Usage

LiveStore is designed to be simple yet powerful. Here are some common use cases:

### Managing State

You can easily manage the state of your application using LiveStore's reactive features. When the state changes, your UI will automatically update.

### Synchronizing Data

With the built-in sync engine, you can keep your data in sync across multiple devices. This is especially useful for applications that require real-time collaboration.

### Offline Support

LiveStore prioritizes local data storage, allowing your application to function even when offline. Once the connection is restored, the data will sync automatically.
