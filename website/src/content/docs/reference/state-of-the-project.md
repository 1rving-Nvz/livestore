## Current state

- LiveStore is currently in *private early access* and available as an *alpha release*.
  - **private early access**: To keep the development sustainable and level of feedback manageable, LiveStore is currently only available in early access to GitHub sponsors. We plan to offer public access to LiveStore early 2025.
  - **alpha release**: LiveStore is still under heavy development which includes breaking changes and database resets during version upgrades. We expect LiveStore to reach a relatively stable state (beta) in early 2025.
