title: Note on package management

## Recommended

It's strongly recommended to use `pnpm` or `bun` when building an app with LiveStore to avoid dependency issues (e.g. wrong version resolution, duplicate dependencies, etc).

### Peer dependencies

Since LiveStore has a few peer dependencies, you either should manually add them to your project or add the `@livestore/peer-deps` package to your project to satisfy them.

### PNPM Catalog

When using `pnpm`, we recommend specifying the following packages in your [PNPM Catalog](https://pnpm.io/catalogs):

```
# pnpm-workspace.yaml
# ...
catalog:
  effect: 3.13.1 # As LiveStore
	# also `react`, `react-dom` etc based on your project
```
