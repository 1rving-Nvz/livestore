Please follow LiveStore's [guiding principles](/docs/contributing/contributing#guiding-principles) when writing docs.

## Writing style

This project broadly tries to follow the [Prisma docs style guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/about/style-guide/writing-style).

## Reusing code

When including code snippets, please try to `import` the code from the source in order to avoid duplication.
