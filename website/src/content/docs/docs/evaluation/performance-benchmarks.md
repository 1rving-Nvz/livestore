Unfortunately, there isn't much to see here yet.

Doing benchmarks right takes a lot of time and effort. LiveStore currently doesn't have enough resources to do this but anyone is welcome to contribute benchmarking results.

In the future, it would be great to have benchmarks for:

- end-to-end syncing (across sync backends)
  - should both show latency and throughput
- boot time (across platforms)
  - both for initial app open and reopens
- local reactivity (across framework integrations)
  - Should be mostly on par with other cutting edge frameworks
