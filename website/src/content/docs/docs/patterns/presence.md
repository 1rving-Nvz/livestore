description: How to implement presence functionality with LiveStore
---

LiveStore doesn't yet have any built-in presence functionality (e.g. to track online/offline users).

Common presence use cases are:
- Track which users are online / in a room
- Track which users are typing (e.g. in a chat)
- Text cursor (similar to Google Docs)
- Cursor movements (similar to Figma)

For now it's recommend to implement presence functionality in your application or use a third party service (e.g. Liveblocks).
