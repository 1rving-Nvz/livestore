LiveStore doesn't yet support encryption but might in the future.
See [this issue](https://github.com/livestorejs/livestore/issues/70) for more details.

For now you can implement encryption yourself e.g. by encrypting the events using a custom Effect Schema definition which applies a encryption transformation to the events.
