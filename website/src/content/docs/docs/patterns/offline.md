title: Offline Support
---

- LiveStore supports offline data management out of the box. In order to make your app work fully offline, you might need to also consider the following:
  - Design your app in a way to treat the network as an optional feature (e.g. when relying on other APIs / external data)
	- Use service workers to cache assets locally (e.g. images, videos, etc.)
