## Can I use an ORM or query builder with LiveStore?

It's possible to use most ORMs/query builders with LiveStore (as long as they are able to synchronously generate SQL statements). You should also give the built-in LiveStore query builder a try.

## Is there a company behind LiveStore? How does LiveStore make money?

LiveStore is developed by [Johannes Schickling](https://github.com/schickling) and has been incubated as the foundation of [Overtone](https://overtone.pro) (a local-first music app). The plan is to keep the development of LiveStore as sustainable as possible via sponsorships and other paths (e.g. commercial licenses, paid consulting, premium devtools, etc).
