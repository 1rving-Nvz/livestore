LiveStore doesn't provide any built-in functionality to deal with external data. However, LiveStore was designed with this use case in mind (e.g. Overtone integrates with lots of external data like Spotify, ...). One way to deal with external data is to also model it as an event log and materialize it into LiveStore state as well.

(If you're interested in learning more about the solution we're using for Overtone, get in touch.)
