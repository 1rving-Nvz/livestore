description: How to manage files with LiveStore
---

LiveStore doesn't have built-in support for file management but it's easy to use LiveStore alongside existing file storage solutions (e.g. S3).

The basic idea is to store the file metadata (e.g. url, name, size, type) in LiveStore and the file content separately.

## Example

```ts
// TODO (contribution welcome)
```
