LiveStore doesn't yet have any built-in support for rich text editing. It's currently recommended to use a purpose-built library (e.g. [Yjs](https://yjs.dev/) or [Automerge](https://automerge.org/)) for this use case in combination with LiveStore.

The idea here is to reference the rich text document from within LiveStore's event log and sync both in parallel.

## Example

```ts
// TODO
```
